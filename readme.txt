There is a single paddle along the bottom, and the player can move the paddle 
left and right across the screen by following the instruction.
Everytime the ball breaks a break, player will get 5 SCOREs.
Everytime player catches the ball, player will get 10 SCOREs.
When a break breaks, there will be a chance to drop a buff ball.
When player got the buff ball, there will be some changes in game:
     - Shorter the paddle or
     - Longer the paddel or
     - Larger the size of the ball or
     - Restore all the settings to default or
     - Random the speed or
     - Deduct 100 SCOREs

When player clears all the breaks, player can either exit the game, or start a 
new game (maybe a different map).
Anytime the player can restart the game.
The first round will be always the standarded map, but there are 4 kinds of map
the player may encounter.
